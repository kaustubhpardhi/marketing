Create a registration form for the admin to fill in the details of the surveyors such as their name, email, phone number, and any other relevant information.

When the admin submits the form, you can save the surveyor details in a database or a file for later use.

Generate a unique login ID and password for each surveyor using a secure random password generator. You can also provide an option for the surveyors to change their password later.

Notify the surveyors of their login credentials through email or SMS, along with any other relevant instructions on how to access the form.

Create a login page for the surveyors where they can enter their login credentials and access the form. You can use a secure authentication mechanism such as HTTPS and password hashing to ensure the security of the login credentials.

Create a dashboard for the admin to track the form entries and monitor the performance of the surveyors. You can display the number of form entries per surveyor, the time taken to complete each form, and any other relevant metrics.

Provide an option for the admin to add or remove surveyors from the system, update their details, and reset their passwords if necessary.
